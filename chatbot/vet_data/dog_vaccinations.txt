Core Dog Vaccinations:
Rabies: Legally required in most areas. Protects against a fatal viral disease.
Distemper: Protects against a severe, contagious viral illness.
Parvovirus (Parvo): Protects against a highly contagious and often deadly gastrointestinal virus, especially in puppies.
Adenovirus (Hepatitis): Protects against infectious canine hepatitis.

Non-Core Dog Vaccinations (based on lifestyle and risk):
Bordetella (Kennel Cough): Recommended for dogs that are boarded, go to daycare, or frequent dog parks.
Leptospirosis: Recommended for dogs exposed to wildlife or contaminated water.
Lyme Disease: Recommended for dogs in areas with high tick prevalence.

Puppy Vaccination Schedule:
Puppies typically start vaccinations around 6-8 weeks of age and receive boosters every 3-4 weeks until they are around 16-20 weeks old.
Your veterinarian will create a specific schedule based on your puppy's needs and local disease risks.
